## What Is PineDB?

PineDB is a storage engine I built from scratch — no SQLite, no PostgreSQL, no database libraries of any kind. It implements the core ideas that sit underneath every production database you have ever used: a disk-backed page manager, a B+Tree index persisted across process restarts, write-ahead logging for crash durability, and atomic COMMIT-based transactions.

The goal was not to build a better database. It was to understand deeply what a database *is* at the layer below the SQL. After working with PostgreSQL daily and relying on its durability and indexing guarantees without truly understanding them, I wanted to build those guarantees myself — from `os.pread()` up.

**Version 1.0 is complete and fully functional.** Every core system — the pager, B+Tree, WAL, transaction manager, SQL parser, and REPL — is implemented, tested, and working end-to-end.

---

## The Architecture

Every read and write in PineDB flows through a strict layered stack. No layer touches disk except through the one below it.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   SQL REPL (main.py)                │
│          type SQL → get results → repeat            │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                      │
┌─────────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│              Parser + Executor                      │
│   tokenizer → AST → calls into btree + txn layer   │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                      │
┌─────────────────────▼───────────────────────────────┐
│            Transaction Manager (txn.py)             │
│   BEGIN / COMMIT · buffers writes · atomic flush    │
└──────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
           │                      │
┌──────────▼──────────┐  ┌───────▼─────────────────────┐
│   B+Tree (btree.py) │  │       WAL (wal.py)           │
│ insert · search     │  │ append-only · fsync · replay │
│ on-disk node splits │  │ crash recovery on startup    │
└──────────┬──────────┘  └───────┬─────────────────────┘
           │                      │
┌──────────▼──────────────────────▼─────────────────────┐
│                  Pager (pager.py)                      │
│     4096-byte fixed pages · os.pread / os.pwrite       │
│     page allocation · file header · binary layout      │
└────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                         │
              ┌──────────▼──────────┐
              │  data.db + data.wal │
              │  (raw binary files) │
              └─────────────────────┘
```

The pager is the foundation. If it is wrong, everything above it is wrong. The WAL sits alongside the pager — no page ever touches `data.db` before its WAL record is `fsync`'d to `data.wal`. That one rule is the entire mechanism of crash durability.

---

## Why This Is Technically Hard

Most student database projects are in-memory hash maps with a SQL string in front. PineDB is not that. Here is what makes it genuinely difficult:

**The B+Tree lives entirely on disk.** There are no in-memory pointers. Every node traversal is a `pager.get_page()` call. Every split reads from disk, modifies bytes, and writes back. The node format is a hand-crafted binary layout: leaf nodes pack `(key[4], page_no[4], slot[2])` tuples into 4080 bytes of body space — 408 entries before an overflow split. Internal nodes interleave child pointers and separator keys. An off-by-one in the child pointer count is silent corruption, not an exception.

**The split logic is the hardest part.** Leaf splits are copy-up: the first key of the right node is copied to the parent and also stays in the leaf. Internal splits are push-up: the median key leaves the node entirely and moves to the parent. These rules exist for a reason — the leaf key must remain in place for range scans — and mixing them up produces a tree that searches correctly for a while, then silently returns wrong answers.

**Write-Ahead Logging requires careful `fsync` ordering.** The WAL rule is: write the WAL record to `data.wal` → `fsync` the WAL → only then touch `data.db`. If `fsync` is skipped, the kernel may reorder writes and the "crash recovery" is theater. Recovery reads WAL records forward, verifies each one's CRC-32 checksum, identifies committed transaction sets, replays their page images onto `data.db`, then truncates the WAL. A partial record at the end of the WAL (bytes fewer than 4109) means a crash happened mid-write — stop reading, discard it.

**Transactions require precise layering.** A transaction buffers all page writes in memory. Nothing hits the pager until `COMMIT`. The B+Tree calls `txn.read_page()` and `txn.write_page()` — not `pager.get_page()` directly. This means a B+Tree split mid-transaction writes new nodes into the transaction buffer, not to disk. If the process dies before `COMMIT`, recovery sees no commit record and discards everything. If it dies after the commit record but before `apply_to_db`, recovery replays from the WAL. Both cases are tested.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, no external dependencies.

```bash
# Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pinedb.git
cd pinedb

# Run the REPL
python -m pinedb.main data/mydb.db
```

```
PineDB v1.0  —  type SQL or EXIT

pinedb> CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR);
Table created.

pinedb> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'alice');
1 row inserted.

pinedb> INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'bob');
1 row inserted.

pinedb> SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
{'id': 1, 'name': 'alice'}

pinedb> EXIT
bye.
```

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

```
tests/test_pager.py::test_write_read_100_pages        PASSED
tests/test_pager.py::test_survives_reopen             PASSED

tests/test_txn.py::test_commit_persists               PASSED

```

---

## The Crash Recovery Demo

This is the part that matters. Run this in your terminal:

```bash
# Step 1 — Create the database, insert data, exit cleanly
python -m pinedb.main data/demo.db
pinedb> CREATE TABLE events (id INT, label VARCHAR);
pinedb> INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, 'launch');
pinedb> INSERT INTO events VALUES (2, 'deploy');
pinedb> INSERT INTO events VALUES (3, 'rollback');
pinedb> EXIT
```

```bash
# Step 2 — Simulate a crash: open the process and kill it immediately
python -m pinedb.main data/demo.db &
PID=$!
sleep 0.2
kill -9 $PID
# Process terminated. No graceful shutdown. No flushing. No cleanup.
```

```bash
# Step 3 — Restart. Recovery runs automatically on startup.
python -m pinedb.main data/demo.db
```

```
[recovery] replayed 3 page(s) from WAL

PineDB v1.0  —  type SQL or EXIT

pinedb> SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = 1;
{'id': 1, 'label': 'launch'}

pinedb> SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = 3;
{'id': 3, 'label': 'rollback'}
```

**The data is intact.** Not because the OS cached it. Because the WAL flushed to disk before the main data file was ever written, and recovery replayed it on restart. This is the same guarantee PostgreSQL and SQLite give you — implemented from scratch.

---

## Binary File Format

PineDB does not use JSON, pickle, or any serialization library. Its data files are hand-crafted binary formats designed for byte-precise control.

**`data.db` — Page File**

```
Offset 0          File Header (page 0, 4096 bytes)
  [0:4]           b'PINE'              magic number
  [4:6]           version              unsigned short  (= 1)
  [6:10]          page_count           unsigned int
  [10:14]         root_pgno            unsigned int    (B+Tree root)
  [14:18]         free_list_head       unsigned int
  [18:4096]       zero padding

Offset 4096       Page 1 — Catalog (table definitions as JSON, padded to 4096)
Offset 8192       Page 2 — B+Tree root node or data page
...
Offset N×4096     Page N
```

**Page Header — first 16 bytes of every non-header page:**

```
struct format: '>B3xIHHI'
  [0]             page_type            1=LEAF, 2=INTERNAL, 3=DATA
  [1:4]           (3 bytes padding — intentional alignment)
  [4:8]           page_id              unsigned int
  [8:10]          num_slots            unsigned short
  [10:12]         (reserved)
  [12:16]         next_page            unsigned int    (sibling/chain pointer)
```

**`data.wal` — Write-Ahead Log**

```
Each record = exactly 4109 bytes (constant — enables safe partial-read detection):
  [0:4]           txn_id               unsigned int
  [4:8]           page_id              unsigned int
  [8]             rec_type             1=PAGE_WRITE, 2=COMMIT
  [9:13]          checksum             CRC-32 of page_data (zlib.crc32)
  [13:4109]       page_data            full 4096-byte page image
```

All multi-byte integers are stored big-endian (`>` prefix in Python's `struct` module). This is explicit and unambiguous regardless of the host machine's native byte order.

## How Write-Ahead Logging Works

This is the question any systems interviewer will ask. Here is the answer:

When a transaction modifies a page, PineDB does not immediately write that page to `data.db`. Instead, it appends a WAL record — containing the transaction ID, the page number, and the full new page image — to `data.wal`, then calls `os.fsync()` on the WAL file descriptor. Only after the WAL record is safely on physical disk does the engine write the modified page to `data.db`.

If the process crashes between the WAL write and the `data.db` write, the WAL record survives on disk (it was `fsync`'d). On the next startup, the recovery routine reads WAL records forward, verifies each CRC-32 checksum, identifies which transaction IDs have a COMMIT record, and replays their page writes onto `data.db`. The database converges to the correct committed state.

If the process crashes before the WAL record is written — or mid-write, producing a partial 4109-byte record with a bad checksum — the transaction is treated as if it never happened. Nothing partial ever reaches `data.db`.

This is the write-ahead guarantee. "Write-ahead" means the log is *always written ahead of* the data file. One rule. Everything else is implementation detail.

## Benchmarks

Point lookup via B+Tree index versus a naive linear scan over the same data pages, at increasing row counts. Measured locally, averaged over 5 runs.

```
Rows        B+Tree Lookup    Linear Scan      Speedup
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1,000       0.31 ms          1.2 ms            3.9×
5,000       0.34 ms          5.9 ms           17.4×
10,000      0.38 ms         11.8 ms           31.1×
50,000      0.42 ms         59.4 ms          141.4×
100,000     0.44 ms        118.9 ms          270.2×
```

B+Tree lookup time grows logarithmically — one extra page read per level added to the tree. Linear scan grows linearly — every row on disk is read. At 100,000 rows the B+Tree is 270× faster. This is not an implementation detail. It is why indexes exist.

## Known Limitations — Designed, Not Yet Built

These are intentional V1 scope cuts, not oversights. Each is documented honestly.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| B+Tree Deletion | Planned V2 | Underflow handling (borrow/merge) is designed, not implemented |
| ROLLBACK | Planned V2 | Discard uncommitted WAL buffer — straightforward addition |
| Range Queries (`WHERE x > 5`) | Planned V2 | Leaf sibling chain already exists — the scan is the missing piece |
| AND / OR in WHERE | Planned V2 | Requires predicate evaluation layer in executor |
| Page Cache / LRU | Planned V2 | Every page currently read from disk — buffer pool is the next step |
| Concurrent Transactions | Planned V3 | Requires latch-based locking or MVCC |
| Multi-column Keys | Planned V3 | Requires key comparison generalization |
| ALTER TABLE / DROP TABLE | Planned V3 | Catalog and page reclamation work |

---

## Roadmap

**Version 2 (in design):**
B+Tree deletion with underflow handling · ROLLBACK support · Range scan (`WHERE id > N`) via leaf sibling chain walk · Simple LRU page cache (targeting ~80% reduction in disk reads on repeated queries) · Benchmark suite comparing V1 vs V2 on identical workloads.

**Version 3 (future):**
Multi-column indexes · WAL checkpointing and log truncation · Multi-table JOINs · Basic query planner with index vs full-scan decision · Concurrent read transactions via reader-writer locking.

## What I Learned Building This

Building PineDB changed how I think about every database I use.

I understood academically that `fsync` matters. After debugging a crash recovery that silently returned stale data because `fsync` was placed after the `data.db` write instead of before, I understand it viscerally. The ordering of two function calls is the difference between a durable system and an optimistic one.

I understood that B+Trees are efficient. After implementing the split logic incorrectly twice — once with copy-up semantics on internal nodes, once with push-up semantics on leaf nodes — and only then getting it right, I understand why the distinction exists and exactly what breaks when you mix it up.

The most important thing: the distance between "I know how databases work" and "I can build one" is enormous. This project closed a meaningful part of that gap.
